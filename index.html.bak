        <h1>Grit.</h1>
        <h2>Ideas in execution.</h2>
        <p>A grindstone that had not grit in it, how long would it take to sharpen an ax?"<br>&ndash;Henry Ward Beecher</p>
        <p>Grit is a team of mad, passionate creative thinkers who do whatever it takes to deliver work that makes a difference.</p>
        <p>We don't waste minutes. We don't waste dollars. We just get right down to the business of ideas. </p>
        <p>By collaborating with our clients throughout the incubation process, we are able to generate, develop and implement more powerful, holistic campaigns in a shorter amount of time.</p>
        <p>We do this because as creatives, we are compelled to create. We can't help ourselves. We are completely addicted to and in love with what we do. And we'd love the opportunity to do it with you.</p>
        <p>Together, we solve. And win.</p>
        <p>All it takes is Grit.</p>
